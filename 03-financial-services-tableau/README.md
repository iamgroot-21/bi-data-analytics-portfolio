### Key Tableau Calculations
```tableau
// Portfolio Return Calculation
[Portfolio Return] = 
SUM([Current Value] - [Previous Value]) / SUM([Previous Value])

// Risk-Adjusted Return (Sharpe Ratio)
[Sharpe Ratio] = 
([Portfolio Return] - [Risk Free Rate]) / [Portfolio Volatility]

// Value at Risk (VaR)
[VaR 95%] = 
[Portfolio Value] * [Portfolio Volatility] * 1.645

// Customer Lifetime Value
[Customer Lifetime Value] = 
SUM([Monthly Revenue]) * [Average Customer Lifetime] * [Retention Rate]

// Asset Allocation Percentage
[Asset Allocation %] = 
SUM([Asset Class Value]) / SUM([Total Portfolio Value])

// Risk Exposure Score
[Risk Exposure Score] = 
CASE [Asset Class]
WHEN "Equities" THEN [Allocation] * 0.8
WHEN "Fixed Income" THEN [Allocation] * 0.3
WHEN "Alternatives" THEN [Allocation] * 0.6
ELSE [Allocation] * 0.5
END
```

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Parameter Controls
```tableau

WHEN "QTD" THEN "Quarter to Date"
WHEN "YTD" THEN "Year to Date"

[Rolling 12-Month Return] = 
LOOKUP([Portfolio Return], -12)

// Risk-Adjusted Return
[Risk Adjusted Return] = 
([Portfolio Return] - [Risk Free Rate]) / [Portfolio Volatility]

[Maximum Drawdown] = 
MIN([Cumulative Return] - [Peak Value])

// Information Ratio
[Information Ratio] = 
([Portfolio Return] - [Benchmark Return]) / [Tracking Error]
