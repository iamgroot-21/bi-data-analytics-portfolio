## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Data Model Architecture
```
Fact Tables:
├── Patient_Admissions
├── Patient_Discharges
├── Financial_Transactions
├── Quality_Metrics
└── Operational_Events

Dimension Tables:
├── Patients
├── Providers
├── Departments
├── Diagnosis_Codes
├── Insurance_Plans
└── Date_Calendar
```

### Key DAX Measures
```dax
// Patient Volume Metrics
Total Patients = COUNTROWS(Patient_Admissions)
Average Length of Stay = AVERAGE(Patient_Admissions[Length_of_Stay_Days])

// Financial Metrics
Total Revenue = SUM(Financial_Transactions[Revenue_Amount])
Revenue per Patient = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Patients])

// Quality Metrics
Readmission Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Patient_Admissions), 
        Patient_Admissions[Readmission_Flag] = "Yes"),
    [Total Patients]
)

// Time Intelligence
Revenue MTD = CALCULATE([Total Revenue], DATESMTD(Date_Calendar[Date]))
Revenue YTD = CALCULATE([Total Revenue], DATESYTD(Date_Calendar[Date]))
```

### Advanced Features
- **Row-Level Security**: Department-based access control
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Cross-filtering across all visualizations
- **Drill-Through**: Detailed patient-level analysis
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for tablet and mobile viewing
- **Real-Time Refresh**: Automated data refresh every 4 hours
